The worst planet ever.

Did iconic Marriane Thornberry just forces you to
have a plastic surgerry. Since years you still a child?
Should you stay or leave? Are you a good comedian?
Are you iconic or does your tallents make you pathetic?
What do the best pirates ever and santa think about
Meg Griffin? Are you still iconic? How much do you
pay for ukrainian army? Is your real job iconic?
Is a Trump tower just felt on you and crushed a peepee?
Is american pies this good?
