Demon: face me right now even if you don't know how,
you will bow even if not right now you pathetic
that this is almost against my ethics my antics
is to make you feel pain and that's exactly what my game
is if you ever able to get over this i'm like a huricane
against not even a drop of rain you must be insane
there's nothing to gain for you except for a lot of
shame when you'll be defeated and beated rise above your
head and drop ten levels below wanted or not you will
get low and consider my demon words to praise the dark lords
to eat the flesh of innocent f..k them and laugh at any
incorrect and moral dirty sunk in voilence and blood
and ever again and again say why not as long as this
world is hot from fire of hell that is our hall of fame
and we love it all to well.

Arcangel Gabriel: Hold on hold on your mouth is dirty
and tounge is too long that it even scary very
not to be done to even close to f..k somebody at all
and all you belong is hell and the holy ground says
so long to your nasty dark lord con that kinda
obviously so wrong that even child can tell it smell
so for your own good be gone until people still
believe there's something left of your ethics what
had you expected this to sound poetic you
dead beat style sound like a death to a good time
you good for nothing half dead no good for
mc so compared to the style made by me this is
obviously what people see. And tell your dark lord
to never fight our songs and music and if to talk
about shame your not the one for this word to use it.
Now punch your self out of anger and be gone and once 
again so long and that is how we don't get along
to consider your words for what for laughs and
let us clap to the angel team for another blast.
Round.

Archangel Michael: Hold on hold on and let me see
is this a poor excuse of deamon standing next to me
and do you understand im too fat to let you through
and if you're wet consider not approaching me yet
because what's wet is actualy pee from imagining yourself
most likely crushed by me now fall on your knees boy woohoo
and hoi hoi if someone here to be f..ked is you
my weak deamon posing not gramaticaly correct baby lyrics
only for girls toy and if you wish us never know such
a joy you should of never be coming because obviously
wearing a title of a demon requires you
not baby crying about your scared half dark half yellow lord almost coming but infact scared of Archangel Michael and
my man Gabriel be stomping and choping you a half and three
with our almost as our god good like song so i beg your sorry
a..s for your own good step aside son and never bring your
dead in a head beats with you along. Now shu and move on and from this holly land be gone. With that said this strong
i am not to consider your deamon words at all. And if
this is not enough i'll strike you in a head with
this Thors Mallot of a fist hand.

Elder demon: Wait a second and let me just ask why
am i still not impressed calling beats dead like
it's a crime against the rhyme like being dark
is completely not in trends or
fashion confuse us please about what to see as a good time
and might our dark lord also claim to be holly
so you're b and s don't spread like a fake a..s kids jolly
to be honest even a child like s..x and violance
if to ask them and not make them listen in a silence.
What if you let them for a second think and
might they see that is you who stink and
the dark lord is actualy cool a..s
powerful freak of joy instead of your boring
a..s so called rules that suck so much that thay
might thing oh boy who are we listening 
let's instead f..k everything up
as we team up with team dark and for dark
lords sake shut the f..k up and dont bark.

GOD: Hello whatsup and praise the lord
i swear to god i am divided betwean this
four good songs but since this sneaky b..tch
dark lord is missing i am here to
suggest the team archangel is the
ones we're listening and since im judge
to even to my self im sorry but i
send team demons back to hell until
they come prepared.
