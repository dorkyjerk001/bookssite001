Roxxie Storm
Chaotic-neutral rock riot with a bottle in one hand and rebellion in the other. Lives loud, loves reckless, and treats rules like guitar strings — meant to snap. Once mooned a journalist mid-interview just to prove her “naked ass” wasn’t the story. Buys burgers for runaway fans before dragging them into the mosh pit. Hates hypocrisy, drinks cheap whiskey like oxygen, and fears mediocrity more than death. Flirts like a dare, feels like feedback, and vanishes before sunrise. For Roxxie, life’s one long encore — sweaty, loud, and unapologetically real.
