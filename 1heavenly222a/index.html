    going down anyway
  </div>

  <div class="verse">
    <div class="speaker">Crusher:</div>

  </div>

  <div class="verse">
    <div class="speaker">Necron:</div>
    Ugh! No!!! Um-am but infact<br />
    our dark lord would allow that and<br />
    thanks to him kid can enjoy violance<br />
    and why not because he can lift you<br />
    with only one arm and rip apart<br />
    pull out your spine and crash<br />
    your dumb head with only one light<br />
    movement of hand! Get em Crusher
  </div>

  <div class="verse">

  <div class="verse">
    <div class="speaker">Necron:</div>
    See? Even a child brain<br />
    will describe you as lame<br />
    i hope it's a lot of pain<br />
    to be an MC like that and<br />
    i don't care how would you react<br />
    because you're so dead with<br />
    that said i'll still fuck your<br />
    dead corpse and ofcourse let<br />
    Crusher pee pee on that what is<br />
    left of you in the end becuase<br />
    that's what it is for you<br />
    and stfu and you're so fake<br />
    and not true and dark lords<br />
    gang do not deserve an opponent like<br />
    you it's too easy and why can't you<br />
    see uncle stinky poo poo just went<br />
    choo choo as a train of my long<br />
    ass punchline went up your ass<br />
    and when if fuck your dead corpse<br />
    your ass is mine and for now it will<br />
    suit my needs just fine. round<br />
    and by this round im proud. 
  </div>

  <div class="verse">
    <div class="speaker">Gatekeeper:</div>
    You demons never change<br />
    but this time you made my day as<br />
    your rhyme is a mess and im impressed<br />
    because it might seem like all you care about<br />
    is dead mans ass and not a single word<br />
    i've heard about that we must obey the<br />
    dark lord wich means if im accept your<br />
    punchline technicaly god is still our<br />
    true lord and talking about lame how<br />
    about going insane about the sex you have'nt<br />
    had yet wich my apear yor fantasies made<br />
    you a dark lord army reject
  </div>

  <div class="verse">
    <div class="speaker">God:</div>
    Good god im blessed by today<br />
    realy infact why dark lord we must obey<br />
    and the fact he still haven't showed up...
  </div>

  <div class="verse">
    <div class="speaker">Necron:</div>
    But he might be listening...
  </div>

  <div class="verse">
    <div class="speaker">God:</div>
    But that would still not matter<br />
    because why would he bother about some<br />
    demon fantasies dude you obviously<br />
    still don't get what the battle is<br />
    i'm sorry my suggestion is team<br />
    holly has a title and you going<br />
    back to hell more early
  </div>
