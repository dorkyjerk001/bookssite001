Necron: Just to let you know when you die
i'll have sex with your corpse instead of
listening to your pathetic rhyme now
cut the crap and stop wasting our time...

Crusher: gaga booboo

Necron: Not now! Um-am but i guess it's
ok because the angel team is so lame they
going down anyway

Crusher: Can i pee pee?

Necron: Ugh! No!!! Um-am but infact
our dark lord would allow that and
thanks to him kid can enjoy violance
and why not because he can lift you
with only one arm and rip apart
pull out your spine and crash
your dumb head with only one light
movement of hand! Get em Crusher

Crusher: uncle stinky poo poo

Necron: See? Even a child brain
will describe you as lame
i hope it's a lot of pain
to be an MC like that and
i don't care how would you react
because you're so dead with
that said i'll still fuck your
dead corpse and ofcourse let
Crusher pee pee on that what is
left of you in the end becuase
that's what it is for you
and stfu and you're so fake
and not true and dark lords
gang do not deserve an opponent like
you it's too easy and why can't you
see uncle stinky poo poo just went
choo choo as a train of my long
ass punchline went up your ass
and when if fuck your dead corpse
your ass is mine and for now it will
suit my needs just fine. round
and by this round im proud. 

Gatekeeper: You demons never change
but this time you made my day as
your rhyme is a mess and im impressed
because it might seem like all you care about
is dead mans ass and not a single word
i've heard about that we must obey the
dark lord wich means if im accept your
punchline technicaly god is still our
true lord and talking about lame how
about going insane about the sex you have'nt
had yet wich my apear yor fantasies made
you a dark lord army reject

God: Good god im blessed by today
realy infact why dark lord we must obey
and the fact he still haven't showed up...

Necron: But he might be listening...

God: But that would still not matter
because why would he bother about some
demon fantasies dude you obviously
still don't get what the battle is
i'm sorry my suggestion is team
holly has a title and you going
back to hell more early
