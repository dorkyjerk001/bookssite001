Loyalty

Tiny kid asks Katya to be he's/her mom.
The unreal guy says Katya is not real and he's
right in his own way. Kid pays Katya's army
with crypto currency and half of them die but not
for the kid but for the Katya's right to be small.
And they did right thing sacrifficing self for a
greater good. Because being small is great.

Oh and Katya is a Miss Universe level bootifull.
